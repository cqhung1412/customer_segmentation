# Introduction



# Methodology



# Requirements

We'll use the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) Jupyter notebook environment (free), with Python 3.7 or higher, and [Microsoft Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) application (free download, Windows only).

### Python packages

* numpy
* pandas
* math
* datetime
* dataprep
* matplotlib

# Execution Guide

For replicating the project, please execute the following steps in order:

1. **[Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/code/customer_segmentation_asia.ipynb)**. Running this notebook the data will be explored, prepared, and the RFM segmentation will be performed. The output will be a [CSV file](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/output/rfm_asia.csv).

2. **[Power BI file](https://github.com/daniel-isidro/customer_segmentation/blob/main/output/customer_segmentation.pbix)**. This is a file that processes the CSV file obtained in the previous step and presents it as a dashboard so it can be leveraged for business actions in the countries.

# Data Acquisition

Data has been obtained from **real sales orders** in 18 countries in a period of around 2 years. Some features (country names, customer id and revenue), have been altered in order to preserve privacy. Number of orders, units and dates have not been modified. It is acquired as a CSV file.
